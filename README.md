# DiSMA - Differential Solver for MATLAB Applications
DiSMA is a library implemented for the numerical solution of 1D and 2D Initial Boundary-Valued Problems (IBVPs) using Finite Element Method (FEM).

The project is developed in partial fullfilment of the requirements for the course of __Numerical Methods for Partial Differential Equations__ as part of MSc programme in Engineering Mathematics at Politecnico di Torino.

The 2D solver is based on the *bbtr30* triangulator, developed by Prof. Berrone at the Dept. of Mathematics at Politecnico di Torino which is shipped with the this library.
